# Davide Garavaso
Hi, I‚Äôm Davide Garavaso, a research fellow and master‚Äôs student in Computer Game
Development from Verona. I am passionate about physics simulation, programming, and video
games, and I aspire to build my career in the video game industry.
My research focuses on cloth segmentation using deep learning and the development of a
cloth simulator in C++ and OpenGL, implementing both physically-based and position-based
techniques. Alongside research, I am expanding my skills through a master‚Äôs program, where
I develop projects in Unreal Engine, Unity, and C++ exploring areas such as physics
programming, gameplay programming and graphic programming.
Driven by curiosity and passion, I am motivated by the opportunity to grow professionally,
learn new technologies, and contribute to new projects in the video game industry.
